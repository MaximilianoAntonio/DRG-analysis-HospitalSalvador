## Usage

### Power BI Analysis

The `SALVADOR.pbix` file contains various visualizations and insights into the hospital's data. Key tables and metrics analyzed include:

- **Demographic Analysis**: Age distribution of patients, highlighting that more than 50% are aged between 60 and 75+.
- **Specialty Demand**: High demand for specialties such as ophthalmology, general surgery, and orthopedics.
- **Patient Admissions**: Analysis of the types of admissions, with a significant portion being emergency and scheduled surgeries.
- **Severity Levels**: Categorization of patients' conditions from non-severe to highly severe.
- **Discharge Types**: Various discharge outcomes including home discharge, referrals, and others.

### Excel Data

The `HSP_GRD.xlsx` file contains raw data used for analysis in the Power BI file. It includes detailed metrics and indicators essential for understanding hospital performance and areas for improvement.

## Data Analysis

### Key Indicators

The analysis focuses on the following five key indicators:

1. **Age Range**: Analysis of patient age distribution, indicating that more than 50% of patients are between 60 and 75+ years old.
2. **Specialties**: Identification of specialties with the highest demand, such as ophthalmology, general surgery, and orthopedics.
3. **Admissions**: Breakdown of patient admissions into categories like emergency and scheduled surgeries.
4. **Severity Levels**: Classification of patient conditions by severity, from non-severe to highly severe.
5. **Discharge Types**: Analysis of discharge outcomes, including home discharge, referrals, and other types.

### DRG Analysis

A DRG (Diagn√≥stico Relacionado por Grupos) analysis categorizes hospital cases into groups based on diagnosis, treatment patterns, and resource usage. This helps in understanding the complexity and cost associated with different types of patient care, enabling better resource allocation and financial management. The DRG analysis in this project offers valuable insights into optimizing hospital operations and improving the quality of patient care.
